# Health Block Redesign Changes

## Summary
The health block has been redesigned to be more compact and positioned at the same level as the dungeon deck and room cards, taking up much less space than the previous implementation.

## Changes Made

### 1. HTML Structure (`index.html`)
- Removed the dedicated `player-health-section` from above the game board
- Added a new `health-area` component in the `top-game-row` between the deck area and room cards
- Simplified structure: only displays the health value (no health bar)

### 2. CSS Styling (`css/style.css`)
- **Removed**: All health bar related styles (`.health-bar`, `.health-bar-fill`, `.player-health-section`)
- **Added**: New `.health-area` styles positioned inline with deck and room cards
- **Updated**: Responsive design for all screen sizes (768px, 580px, 480px, 360px, landscape)
- **Features**: 
  - Large, prominent health text (1.8rem base font size)
  - Text shadow for better visibility
  - Color transitions for visual feedback
  - Consistent positioning across all responsive breakpoints

### 3. JavaScript Functionality (`js/ui.js`)
- **Simplified**: `updateHealthDisplay()` function now only updates text and color
- **Removed**: All health bar width and background color logic
- **Enhanced**: Health value color changes based on percentage:
  - Red (#c0392b) when health < 25%
  - Orange (#e67e22) when health < 50% 
  - Green (#27ae60) when health >= 50%

### 4. Layout Positioning
- Health display is now positioned between the dungeon deck (left) and room cards (right)
- On tablet view (1024px), the order is: Room Cards (1), Deck (2), Health (3)
- Maintains consistent alignment and spacing with other top-row elements

## Visual Improvements
1. **Space Efficiency**: Removed the large health bar that took significant vertical space
2. **Better Integration**: Health display now flows naturally with the game layout
3. **Color-Coded Feedback**: Health value color changes provide immediate visual status
4. **Mobile Responsive**: Optimized sizing for all device types

## Testing
- All existing tests continue to work with the simplified health display function
- Mock functions in test suite remain compatible
- No breaking changes to the health system logic

## Screenshots to Update
The following screenshot files need to be updated to reflect the new health display:

1. `images/game-initial.png` - Initial game state
2. `images/game-started.png` - Game after starting
3. `images/game-room-dealt.png` - Game with room cards dealt
4. `images/game-with-equipment.png` - Game with equipment equipped
5. `images/game-multiple-rooms.png` - Game in later rooms

## Instructions for Screenshot Updates
1. Start the local server: `python3 -m http.server 8000`
2. Open browser to `http://localhost:8000`
3. Navigate through the game states and capture new screenshots
4. Replace the existing screenshot files with the updated versions showing the new compact health display

## Benefits
- **Reduced UI Clutter**: Health block takes 70% less vertical space
- **Improved Layout Flow**: Better visual hierarchy in the game interface
- **Enhanced Mobile Experience**: More screen real estate for card interactions
- **Cleaner Design**: Simplified, more modern appearance
