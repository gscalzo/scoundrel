## 5. Room Cycle  
1. **Option to skip:**  
   * Collect all 4 cards, place them under the dungeon, then deal a fresh 4.  
   * May not skip twice in a row.  
2. **Play any 3 of the 4 cards**, resolving each fully.  
3. **Carry over** the unused 4th card; deal 3 new cards to form the next room.

---

## 6. Combat  
1. **Without a weapon**  
   * Take damage equal to the monster's value, then discard it.  
2. **With a weapon equipped**  
   * Damage taken = monster value − weapon value (minimum 0).  
   * After a kill, slide the monster under the weapon to show its value.  
   * The same weapon may only attack a **strictly weaker** monster than the last it defeated.  
   * Equipping a new weapon discards the old one and its stacked monsters.  
3. You may always fight bare-handed even if a valid weapon is ready.

---

## 7. Potions  
* You may play and drink several ♥ in a turn, but only the **first** heals.

---

## 8. End of Game  
* **Win:** Dungeon deck fully used up.  
* **Lose:** Health reaches 0 or lower at any time.
